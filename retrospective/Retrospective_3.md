## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- 1 of stories committed vs. 1 done 
- Total of 3 points committed vs. 3 points done 
- Total of 81h 30m planned  vs. 80h 35m spent (as a team)

**Notes**: we decided to focus on technical debt, so most of the task done on this sprint are horizontal or focus on fixing existing issues 

 Definition of Done: 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

--------------------------------------------------


- Hours per task average: 
  - (estimate) *2.6* 
  - (actual) *4.2* -> less stories done than planned one and problems encountered
- standard deviation:
  - (actual) *3.42*
  - (estimate) *1.92*

- Total task estimation error ratio: 
  -  $73/80 - 1 = -0.087$
  > - sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing & code review:
  - Total hours estimated 
      - 10h30m
  - Total hours spent 
      - 10h40m
  - Nr of automated unit test cases:
 
      - $67$ total cases $- 19$ existing old cases $=$
      
       $48$ new test cases

      _*it was decided to start using smaller tests
       to close up on issues faster_

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?  
  - Creating the collection of 50 hikes took longer than expected, searching and inserting consistent data for all of them required a bigger effort than the estimated. The same thing can be said about the creation of the collection of hikes with all the related information.  
  - Also solve the issues and the bugs we discovered, was more time-demanding than what we estimated.
  - Some stories have a large time spent since we worked together and this caused a double increase of them.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - large or ambiguous tasks (like the horizontal ones we used), slug the pace and make progress hard to track and communication chaotic.
  - use of shortcuts on immediate implementation make for fast implementation but have severe repercusions on the whole project if not handled correctly.
  - subdividing and specializing although it gives us less flexibility, did allow team members to focus on specific fields and have a better flow of their own work
  
 
- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
 - we improved on speed communication about overall progress and problems that arise.*
  
  *overall although better we do believe it can still be improved

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  - Subdivision of tasks, for the most part we would say that the biggest problem was the large tasks and the lack of technical detail on their descriptions.


- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - Improve the subdivision of stories into smaller tasks more technically specific. To help organize and improve tracking of time.
  - Improve documentation to comunicate the set up of the project to the rest of the team.

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - we managed to fill our static database with relevant and varied data.
