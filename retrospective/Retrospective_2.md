RETROSPECTIVE (Team 1)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- 6 of stories committed vs. 4 done 
- Total of 17 points committed vs. 11 points done 
- Total of 67h 10m planned  vs. 82h 45m spent (as a team)

**Notes**: the total time estimated includes the 6 stories and also _horizontal tasks_ we have create to solve bugs and issue emerged from the Demo 1. Some of them took longer than expected such as create the collection of 50 hikes.

 Definition of Done: 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?  
Creating the collection of 50 hikes took longer than expected, searching and inserting consistent data for all of them required a bigger effort than the estimated. The same thing can be said about the creation of the collection of hikes with all the related information.  
Also solve the issues and the bugs we discovered, was more time-demanding than what we estimated.
Some stories have a large time spent since we worked together and this caused a double increase of them.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?  

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
